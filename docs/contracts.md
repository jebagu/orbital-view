# Module Contracts

Contracts are binding once implemented. If a task needs to change a contract, document the change before editing code.

## Module: OrbitalViewCore

### Responsibility

Own pure data contracts and validation for an orbital 3D speaker viewport.

### Non-Responsibilities

This module must not:

- render UI or 3D graphics
- depend on SwiftUI, AppKit, MetalKit, AVFoundation, MIDI, OSC, playback, or downstream app targets
- parse `.wfield` files
- receive live OSC or MIDI
- decide channel routing
- mutate playback state
- import DomeLab app code

### Public Interface

The first implementation should define Swift value types for:

```text
OrbitalViewSceneSpec
OrbitalViewCoordinateSystem
OrbitalViewVector3
UnitSphereDirection
OrbitalViewShellSpec
OrbitalViewImportedShellGeometry
ShellNode
ShellEdge
ShellFace
OrbitalViewSpeaker
SpeakerAnchor
SpeakerShape
SpeakerVisualRole
SpeakerMeterFrame
SpeakerMeterLevel
OrbitalViewCameraState
OrbitalViewMode
OrbitalViewProjection
OrbitalViewOrbit
OrbitalViewSelection
OrbitalViewEvent
OrbitalViewValidationError
```

Exact Swift names may vary only if the task explains why.

### Inputs

Inputs are host-provided scene and meter data:

- coordinate system
- shell geometry or parametric shell spec
- physical speaker list
- optional virtual objects later
- meter levels keyed by physical channel
- camera state

### Outputs

Core may output:

- validated scene specs
- validation errors
- camera preset states
- selection/event values for renderer or host app use

Core must not output audio, routing changes, playback state mutations, or UI navigation.

### Validation Rules

- Vector components must be finite.
- Unit directions must reject zero vectors and values too far from unit length unless an explicit normalizing initializer is provided.
- Shell radius must be positive and finite.
- Shell edges and faces must reference known nodes.
- Speaker IDs must be unique inside a scene.
- Physical speaker channels must be positive.
- Physical channels should be unique unless a future contract explicitly allows duplicates for non-physical roles.
- Speaker labels must not be empty after trimming.
- Shape dimensions must be positive and finite.
- Edge anchor `t` must be in `0...1`.
- Monitor camera presets must target the origin.

### Side Effects

This module should have no side effects.

### Dependencies

Allowed:

```text
Foundation
```

Forbidden:

```text
SwiftUI
AppKit
MetalKit
AVFoundation
CoreMIDI
networking
Wavefield app targets
Orbisonic app targets
Splat app targets
```

### Tests Required

- unit direction validation
- speaker validation
- shell reference validation
- meter channel identity
- center-locked camera presets
- scene validation

## Module: Future Renderer

### Responsibility

Render a validated `OrbitalViewCore` scene as a native 3D viewport.

### Non-Responsibilities

The renderer must not:

- own audio processing
- reorder channels
- fake meter data
- mutate host playback state
- parse downstream app file formats

### Status

Deferred. Do not implement until a renderer task is opened.

## Module: Future Downstream Adapters

### Responsibility

Convert host app data such as Wavefield speaker layouts and meter frames into `OrbitalViewCore` contracts.

### Boundary Rule

Adapters belong in the lowest target that can cleanly depend on both `OrbitalViewCore` and the host app's layout/meter types.

### Status

Deferred until the actual downstream package layout is inspected during the first code task.
