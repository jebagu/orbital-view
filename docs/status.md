# Project Status

## Current Phase

```text
offscreen renderer smoke test
```

## Current Milestone

```text
Minimal Metal draw path verified offscreen
```

## Summary

Orbital View Kit now has `OrbitalViewCore`, `OrbitalViewWavefield`, an `OrbitalViewRender` MetalKit renderer seam with a minimal offscreen smoke-tested draw path, a compile-only `OrbitalViewSwiftUI` wrapper skeleton, a renderer test harness plan, a disposable browser mockup for the orbitable spherical monitor viewport, and an accepted MetalKit / MTKView production renderer backend decision. Full production visuals, SwiftUI controls/gestures, and downstream app source integration remain deferred.

Protected paths touched:

```text
none
```

Result:

```text
OrbitalViewCore foundation is implemented and verified.
```

Risks:

- Wavefield layout adapter still requires downstream package inspection.
- Renderer backend remains intentionally deferred.

```text
Plan the Wavefield layout adapter or renderer visual mockup as a new bounded task.
```

### Update: 2026-05-19 Wavefield Layout JSON Adapter

Status:

```text
complete
```

Changed:

- Inspected the Wavefield package read-only at `/Users/jeremyguillory/Documents/vibecode projects/wavefield osx`.
- Added `OrbitalViewWavefield` as a local adapter target.
- Added `WavefieldSpeakerLayoutSceneAdapter` to convert Wavefield speaker-layout JSON into `OrbitalViewCore` scenes.
- Copied the real Fey 30 fixture into the test bundle.
- Added tests for channel order, labels, coordinates, caller-provided shell use, unsupported axes, invalid speaker count, and invalid direction rejection.

```

Protected paths touched:

```text
none
```

Result:

```text
Wavefield Fey layout JSON maps into an OrbitalViewCore monitor scene without channel reorder.
```

Risks:

- This adapter reads Wavefield JSON shape directly; a future downstream package adapter may still be useful when integrating with Wavefield types.
- Meter snapshot adaptation remains a separate decision.

Next recommended task:

```text
Choose renderer visual mockup, renderer backend decision, or Wavefield meter-frame adapter.
```

### Update: 2026-05-19 Wavefield Meter Frame Adapter

Status:

```text
complete
```

Changed:

- Added `WavefieldMeterChannelFrame` DTO.
- Added `WavefieldMeterFrameAdapter`.
- Mapped Wavefield-style channel/rms/peak records into `SpeakerMeterFrame`.
- Added duplicate-channel, invalid-channel, non-finite-level, and clip-threshold tests.

Bugs found or fixed:

```text

```

Protected paths touched:

```text
none
```

Result:

```text
Wavefield-style meter frames map into OrbitalViewCore SpeakerMeterFrame without channel reorder.
```

Risks:

- This is a local DTO adapter, not a direct import of Wavefield package types.
- Full app-level VUMeterSnapshot adaptation remains out of scope.

Next recommended task:

```text
Renderer visual mockup or renderer backend decision.
```

### Update: 2026-05-19 Orbital Viewport Visual Mockup

Status:

```text
complete
```

Changed:

- Added a disposable static HTML/CSS/JS mockup for the OrbitalViewKit monitor viewport.
- Added fake Fey-style speaker positions with animated fake meter glow, rings, labels, and selection state.
- Added camera preset controls, reset, projection toggle, structure/speaker/label/cutaway toggles, and an inspector panel.
- Added mockup notes capturing product questions and Swift implementation implications.

```

Protected paths touched:

```text
none
```

Result:

```text
Renderer-facing behavior can be reviewed visually without committing to Swift renderer code yet.
```

Risks:

- The mockup uses fake positions and fake meters, so it is interaction guidance only.
- Production renderer backend was not yet selected at this point; later resolved by Decision 0002.

Next recommended task:

```text
Renderer backend decision, now complete, or first native OrbitalViewSwiftUI/Metal prototype slice.
```

### Update: 2026-05-19 Renderer Backend Decision

Status:

```text
complete
```

Changed:

- Added `docs/decisions/0002-renderer-backend.md`.
- Accepted MetalKit / MTKView as the production renderer backend.
- Documented `OrbitalViewRender` as the future renderer target and `OrbitalViewSwiftUI` as the wrapper layer.
- Rejected WebView, DomeLab code import, SceneKit-first, and RealityKit-first as long-term renderer paths.
- Updated active architecture, contract, flow, test, status, and work-package docs.

Bugs found or fixed:

```text
none
```

Protected paths touched:

```text
none
```

Result:

```text
Renderer backend is no longer open-ended; future production renderer work should start with a MetalKit / MTKView target seam.
```

Risks:

- MetalKit is more engineering work than SceneKit or a browser prototype.
- First renderer source slice should stay compile-focused to avoid overbuilding.

Next recommended task:

```text
Minimal OrbitalViewRender target seam, now complete.
```

### Update: 2026-05-19 OrbitalViewRender Target Seam

Status:

```text
complete
```

Changed:

- Added `OrbitalViewRender` package product and target.
- Added `OrbitalViewRendering`, `OrbitalViewRenderState`, and `OrbitalViewMetalRenderer`.
- Added an `MTKViewDelegate` seam without production drawing.
- Kept scene, meter, camera, and selection update paths separate.
- Added renderer seam tests for revision separation, event emission, and MTKView delegate conformance.

```

Result:

```text
OrbitalViewRender now has a compile-focused MetalKit seam with state/event tests, but no production drawing yet.
```

Risks:

- The renderer is currently a no-op `MTKViewDelegate`; draw-loop behavior remains unimplemented.
- The next source slice should avoid pulling SwiftUI, audio, or host-app dependencies into `OrbitalViewRender`.

Next recommended task:

```text
Compile-only OrbitalViewSwiftUI wrapper skeleton, now complete, or first Metal draw-loop implementation plan.
```

### Update: 2026-05-19 OrbitalViewSwiftUI Wrapper Skeleton

Status:

```text
complete
```

Changed:

- Added `OrbitalViewSwiftUI` package product and target.
- Added public `OrbitalView` SwiftUI view.
- Added internal `OrbitalViewMetalView` `NSViewRepresentable` bridge around `MTKView`.
- Added coordinator logic that applies scene, meter, camera, and selection configuration into `OrbitalViewMetalRenderer`.
- Added SwiftUI wrapper tests for initialization, duplicate-update suppression, meter-only update behavior, and camera/selection event emission.

```

Protected paths touched:

```text

Tests/OrbitalViewSwiftUITests/ allowed by this slice
```

Result:

```text
OrbitalViewSwiftUI now exposes a compile-only SwiftUI wrapper around the MetalKit renderer seam, with tests, but no controls or gestures yet.
```

Risks:

- The wrapper currently bridges state into a no-op renderer delegate.
- Camera gestures, picking, inspector controls, and draw-loop behavior remain unimplemented.

Next recommended task:

```text
Renderer test harness plan, first Metal draw-loop implementation plan, or SwiftUI control/gesture binding plan.
```

### Update: 2026-05-19 Renderer Test Harness Plan

Status:

```text
complete
```

Changed:

- Added `docs/renderer-test-harness.md`.
- Defined renderer harness layers from contract tests through offscreen smoke tests, invariant tests, pixel probes, and optional interactive harness.
- Defined first Metal draw-loop acceptance criteria.
- Updated active test strategy, system flows, implementation map, status, and work-package docs.

Bugs found or fixed:

```text

```

Protected paths touched:

```text
none
```

Result:

```text
The first Metal draw-loop implementation now has explicit verification criteria before code starts.
```

Risks:

- Offscreen Metal tests can be machine-dependent; future tests must skip clearly when no Metal device is available.
- Full-frame snapshots are intentionally deferred until the visual design stabilizes.

Next recommended task:

```text
First Metal draw-loop implementation plan or offscreen renderer smoke tests.
```

### Update: 2026-05-19 Offscreen Renderer Smoke Test

Status:

```text
complete
```

Changed:

- Added `OrbitalViewMetalDrawPipeline` with a minimal Metal render pipeline.
- Added `OrbitalViewMetalRenderer.draw(in:)` command encoding for `MTKView`.
- Added an internal offscreen renderer helper that renders to a BGRA texture and reads pixels back for tests.
- Rendered fixed-size speaker quads from scene speaker anchors.
- Applied meter values to color/intensity without resizing speaker geometry.
- Added an XCTest smoke test that asserts a deterministic scene produces non-clear pixels, with a clear skip when no Metal device exists.

Protected paths touched:

Tests/OrbitalViewRenderTests/ allowed by this slice
```

Result:

```text
OrbitalViewRender can now issue a minimal Metal draw command and prove non-empty offscreen output without opening a host app window.
```

Risks:

- Current drawing is only a smoke baseline: fixed-size speaker quads, no shell geometry, no production camera projection, no labels, and no hit testing.
- Metal availability remains machine-dependent; the test skips clearly when no Metal device exists.

Next recommended task:

```text
Renderer invariant tests or pixel-probe renderer tests.
```

## Open Questions

- Exact downstream repository path for the first Wavefield integration.
- Exact production renderer drawing scope beyond the smoke baseline.

## Decision Log

- `docs/decisions/0001-initial-architecture.md`
- `docs/decisions/0002-renderer-backend.md`
