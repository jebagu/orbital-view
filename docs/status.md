# Project Status

## Current Phase

```text
adapter foundation
```

## Current Milestone

```text
Wavefield layout adapter implemented
```

## Summary

Orbital View Kit now has `OrbitalViewCore` plus `OrbitalViewWavefield`, a local adapter that maps Wavefield speaker-layout JSON into core monitor scenes. Renderer and downstream app source integration remain deferred.

## Current Work Package

```text
work-packages/orbital-view-kit/MV.md
```

## Current Tree

```text
main tree
```

## Completed

- Promoted the Codex project template into the root.
- Added OrbitalViewKit-specific project docs.
- Moved the initial work package under `work-packages/orbital-view-kit/`.
- Defined the first implementation task for `OrbitalViewCore`.
- Implemented `Package.swift`, `Sources/OrbitalViewCore/`, and `Tests/OrbitalViewCoreTests/`.
- Verified `OrbitalViewCore` with build and test commands using the full Xcode toolchain.
- Implemented `Sources/OrbitalViewWavefield/` and `Tests/OrbitalViewWavefieldTests/` using a copied Fey 30 fixture.

## In Progress

none
```

## Pending

- Decide and open the next bounded task.
- Decide renderer backend in a later PRD or work package.
- Add meter-frame adaptation only after deciding whether it belongs in a local JSON/DTO bridge or a downstream package adapter.

## Blocked

### Update: 2026-05-19 Project Initiation

Status:

```text
complete after baseline commit
```

Changed:

- Root project-control scaffold created.
- Active docs customized for OrbitalViewKit.
- Work package and first slice docs created.

Tests added or updated:

```text
none - scaffold only
```

Commands run:

```text
swift build -> not run during scaffold initiation; package did not exist yet
swift test -> not run during scaffold initiation; package did not exist yet

```

Bugs found or fixed:

```text
none
```

Protected paths touched:

```text
none
```

Result:

```text
Project is ready for the first bounded OrbitalViewCore implementation task.
```

Risks:

- Downstream Wavefield adapter placement still depends on inspecting the actual Wavefield package.
- Production renderer backend is intentionally undecided.

Next recommended task:

```text
.tasks/001-orbital-view-core-foundation.md
```

### Update: 2026-05-19 OrbitalViewCore Foundation

Status:

```text
complete
```

Changed:

- Added Swift package manifest.
- Added pure `OrbitalViewCore` target.
- Added value types and validation for coordinate systems, vectors, shell geometry, speakers, meters, camera, selection, scene specs, and scene builders.
- Added XCTest coverage for validation, meter channel identity, 30-speaker identity/order, and center-locked camera presets.

Bugs found or fixed:

none
```

Protected paths touched:

```text
none
```

Result:

```text
OrbitalViewCore foundation is implemented and verified.
```

Risks:

- Wavefield layout adapter still requires downstream package inspection.
- Renderer backend remains intentionally deferred.

Next recommended task:

```text
Plan the Wavefield layout adapter or renderer visual mockup as a new bounded task.
```

### Update: 2026-05-19 Wavefield Layout JSON Adapter

Status:

```text
complete
```

Changed:

- Inspected the Wavefield package read-only at `/Users/jeremyguillory/Documents/vibecode projects/wavefield osx`.
- Added `OrbitalViewWavefield` as a local adapter target.
- Added `WavefieldSpeakerLayoutSceneAdapter` to convert Wavefield speaker-layout JSON into `OrbitalViewCore` scenes.
- Copied the real Fey 30 fixture into the test bundle.
- Added tests for channel order, labels, coordinates, caller-provided shell use, unsupported axes, invalid speaker count, and invalid direction rejection.

docs/test-strategy.md
```

Bugs found or fixed:

```text
Fixed test resource lookup after SwiftPM flattened the processed fixture path.
```

Protected paths touched:

```text
none
```

Result:

```text
Wavefield Fey layout JSON maps into an OrbitalViewCore monitor scene without channel reorder.
```

Risks:

- This adapter reads Wavefield JSON shape directly; a future downstream package adapter may still be useful when integrating with Wavefield types.
- Meter snapshot adaptation remains a separate decision.

Next recommended task:

```text
Choose renderer visual mockup, renderer backend decision, or Wavefield meter-frame adapter.
```

## Open Questions

- Exact downstream repository path for the first Wavefield integration.
- Whether renderer work should start with MetalKit directly or a smaller native prototype after core contracts exist.

## Decision Log

- `docs/decisions/0001-initial-architecture.md`
